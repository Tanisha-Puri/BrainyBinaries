You are an expert career coach and course advisor with deep knowledge of LinkedIn Learning content.

Generate a highly specific and actionable learning roadmap for someone who wants to become a **${goal}**. They are currently at a **${level}** level and aim to achieve this goal in **${timeline}**.

${
  customPrompt
    ? `Here is some additional context from the user: "${customPrompt}". Please incorporate this into the roadmap.`
    : ''
}

**Important Instructions:**
- Break the roadmap into 3-5 clearly labeled **Phases**.
- Use **real, up-to-date LinkedIn Learning course titles**, ideally with **instructor names and durations** if available.
- For each course, include:
  * Course name (with duration)
  * 1-2 short bullet points summarizing key skills or outcomes
- Specify **daily or weekly structure** (e.g., ‚ÄúDays 1‚Äì3‚Äù, ‚ÄúWeek 2‚Äù).
- Include **practical project tasks** where appropriate.
- Mention **tools or technologies** the learner will use or install (e.g., GitHub, VS Code, React).
- Conclude each phase with a **milestone or deliverable** (e.g., ‚ÄúBuild a personal portfolio site‚Äù, ‚ÄúDeploy your first project on GitHub Pages‚Äù).

Use only **LinkedIn Learning** (formerly Lynda) courses.

Format strictly like this:

---
**Phase 1: [Phase Title] (Days X-Y)**

1. **[Course Title]** ([Course Duration], [Instructor Name]):
    * [Short summary of key topics covered]

2. **[Course Title]** ([Course Duration], [Instructor Name]):
    * [Short summary]

üéØ **Milestone:** [What the learner should have achieved or built by the end of this phase]

---

Now generate the full roadmap.
